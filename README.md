![ml-bootcamps](ml-bootcamps.jpg)

Bootcamps and interactive online platforms are an excellent way to acquire new skills. When it comes to Machine Learning and Data Science, there are a variety of different choices that one can choose from. Some provide onsite training and some online. Some focus on video courses, while others on real-life coding projects. In this list, I hope to outline all the most popular choices and help you pick the one that fits your learning style.

For each program, I’ll present a rating borrowed from [Switchup](https://www.switchup.org/), its different locations, an average duration and a handful of recommended courses around Machine Learning and Data Science.

> Switchup is an online platform that gathers resources and information about tech bootcamps and programs. It has compiled alumni reviews for each program alongside with guides and community discussions.

Disclaimer: We couldn’t possibly try out each bootcamp and program, so the information comes from their websites, alumni reviews, and thorough research on the web.
